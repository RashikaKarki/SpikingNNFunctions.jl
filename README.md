Fast spiking neural network primitive functions for use in other packages. The primary purpose of the package is to act as a dependency for [SpikingNN.jl](https://github.com/darsnack/SpikingNN.jl). Exctracting these primitives into their own package allows users to easily extend SpikingNN.jl (similar to NNlib.jl's role to Flux.jl).

For testing, refer to the [SpikingNN.jl](https://github.com/darsnack/SpikingNN.jl) repo where these primitives are covered as part of testing.
